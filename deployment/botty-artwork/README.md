# Cover resolver

Run `server.py` as the dedicated `botty-artwork` user with Python 3 and Pillow,
using the systemd service and authenticated TLS nginx route shipped alongside it.
The API key remains in `/opt/botty-artwork/api-key`, never in this repository.

Scene suffixes such as PROPER and INTERNAL are removed only when the input has
a PS5, CUSA/PPSA title-ID, [FPKG], UPDATE, `v<number>` (for example `v1.02`
or `v10.02`), MULTI, or incl/including marker. The literal word `version` is
not a marker. Release detection and metadata truncation share the same pattern;
PS5, CUSA/PPSA IDs, and [FPKG] are also detected before bracket removal.
Platform markers accept word boundaries, including bracketed IDs and hyphen,
dot, or colon separators (for example `Proper-PPSA12345`). Other metadata
markers require preceding whitespace. Metadata and edition suffixes are
trimmed repeatedly in either order; unmarked canonical scene words are preserved.

Resolution uses normalized game names (scene tags, editions, punctuation, accents,
Roman numerals, trademark symbols), Steam game search/library artwork, Wikipedia
exact article lookup followed by search, then a Steam store banner if no portrait
is available. Matches must preserve the game identity and sequel number. Provider
IDs, source URLs, canonical titles and outcomes are saved next to RGB images.
Positive results last thirty days. Confirmed misses last one hour; network/provider
errors are not negative-cached. Different titles can resolve concurrently; duplicate
lookups coalesce and network concurrency is bounded to four.

Near-uniform provider images are rejected, including grey CDN placeholders returned
with HTTP 200. Existing cached placeholders are re-resolved rather than retained for
thirty days. Battlefield 6 and God of War Sons of Sparta have verified PlayStation
product mappings in the seed file.

For regional names or verified exceptions, `/opt/botty-artwork/aliases.json` can map
a normalized title to a canonical game name. It is read on each request and survives
updates. Example: `{"regionalname":"Canonical Game"}`. No arbitrary image URL is
accepted from the client. HTTPS destinations and redirects are allowlisted, response
sizes and image dimensions are bounded. Images retain their complete composition.

Merge the seed `aliases.json` into the installed alias file when deploying, preserving
operator entries. It covers the eFootball 2027 seasonal name, Sonic Unleashed's
unofficial recompilation port, and Resident Evil 4's explicit remake release name.
The latter uses the verified 2023 PlayStation product in `sources.json`.
It also restores the missing ampersands in The Bearer & The Last Flame and
Snoopy & The Great Mystery Club, and maps WILD HEARTS Karakuri Edition to its game.

Verified PlayStation product pages can be registered in `/opt/botty-artwork/sources.json`
(mapping normalized game names to official product URLs; seed file provided). The
resolver reads Product JSON-LD, verifies the title and sequel, and downloads only
from allowlisted PlayStation origins. Publisher prefixes such as EA SPORTS and
trademark marks do not change identity. This mapping survives service upgrades.

Release 1.5.2 includes verified PS5 product mappings for God of War Sons of Sparta,
Resident Evil 4 (2023), Infliction: Extended Cut, Snoopy & The Great Mystery Club,
and Crazy Chicken Shooter Edition. Keep `Shooter Edition` in Crazy Chicken's name:
it identifies the product and is not a generic edition suffix.

To update an existing installation, retain rollback copies of `server.py`,
`aliases.json` and `sources.json`, replace the server code, and merge both seed
JSON objects into their installed counterparts. Preserve existing operator entries
outside the updated keys. Keep the API key, cache ownership and service user.
Restart only `botty-artwork` if the server code changed; mappings are read on each
request. An alias changes the canonical cache key automatically. For a newly
mapped product with the same canonical name, let its one-hour negative cache expire
or back up and remove only that title's empty RGB cache and matching JSON metadata.
On the console, failed lookups retry after one minute; change Explore pages and
return to request the artwork again. No console binary update is required.

Coverage cannot be guaranteed for every release: games missing from both sources
retain an explicit title placeholder. Do not silently substitute another sequel.
The audit and cached metadata identify unresolved names for later corrections.

Run `python3 test_server.py` to check matching, cache reuse, fallback, outage retry,
origin restrictions and persistent aliases without public network requests.
