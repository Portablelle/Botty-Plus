# Botty+ Library compression

Botty+ 1.2 integrates a pinned PS5-Game-Compressor worker with a separate,
journaled Library workflow. Upstream: gcoding97/PS5-Game-Compressor,
commit `7769e8526e286a354f25c77ca64ebb27981c0228`. See `NOTICE.md` for permission
and dependency notices, and `provenance.json` for the source archive digest.

## Use

Select a PS5 folder game in Library, open Options and select **Compress game**.
Botty creates exFAT-in-FFPFSC without deleting the original. Downloads remain
available; extraction and conflicting file operations wait for compression.
Space for both copies plus a 1 GiB reserve is required.

When prompted, close Botty+ and any game. The service selects and mounts the
compressed image, checks file names/sizes, then makes it ready with **Not verified**.
It does not automatically read all decompressed bytes. The original is retained.

The service web UI offers **Verify compressed copy** to compare every byte later,
and **Skip verification** to stop at a read boundary and keep **Not verified**.
The original must still exist. An explicit **Delete uncompressed copy** action
removes the backup without a new full comparison; test the game first. Restore
selects the original again and keeps the compressed image.

Only tracked PS5 folders are supported. Existing images, Botty's own title,
links/special files and APR games without an existing nonempty `ampr_emu.index` are refused. Existing indexes are preserved and verified with the game files. LEGO
Voyagers was used for console acceptance; this is not a compatibility guarantee
for every title. See `VALIDATION.md` for precise test results.

Interrupted activation or deletion stays locked with a recovery message. Do not
repeat a request whose outcome is unknown or manually delete its backup. A retained
original can be restored through Library. No automatic repair, forced unmount,
ShadowMount restart or Kstuff pointer manipulation is performed.

## Architecture and build

The worker binds only loopback port 5910 and authenticates with a random token.
Its API exposes copying, status, cancellation and idle shutdown. Source deletion
and source activation are owned by Botty, using ShadowMount's loopback API.
Per-game records and operation phases persist under `/data/botty/compressor`.
The native app can close while the service continues the operation.

Run `python3 prepare.py` in a clean component directory to verify and unpack the
pinned archive and apply the copy-only, Library, storage and runtime-identity patches. Build `build/` with SDK v0.43:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/build:/work" -w /work botty-ps5-build:0.43 \
  make -j2 BUILD_VERSION=botty-library-1.3
```

Host checks:

```sh
make -C ../botty native test-compressor test-compression-library
make -C ../botty-native test preview compression-integration
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The source-only validator independently decodes PFSC and nested exFAT and compares
SHA-256 against a separate source manifest. Its success does not establish game
runtime compatibility. Runtime Library verification reads through the actual PS5
kernel mount and compares all files byte for byte.

Private console evidence and rollback binaries are excluded from public source
packages. App/service rollback preserves installed games, torrent jobs and archives.

A power loss or rest-mode interruption can leave hidden `.gc-compress.tmp` and
`.gc-compress.tmp.vhash` files in the private output directory. Copy compression
does not resume those files. With Botty service 1.2.2, select **Compress game**
again after a failed/cancelled attempt: its tracked temporary pair is removed
before the free-space check, then compression restarts from zero. The original
and other games are preserved; completed images still require inspection.


### 1.3 destinations

The `library-1.3` worker accepts a Botty-selected internal or mounted exFAT USB
output root. It writes the image and sidecar directly there, while the original
folder stays on its source disk. Botty owns disk selection, durable identities,
source retention and ShadowMount activation; the worker retains its copy-only
contract. External hardware acceptance remains pending.

The authenticated `GET /api/status` response keeps `bottyWorker: "library-1.3"`
as its ABI identifier and adds `version: "1.3.1"` and a positive `pid` from
`getpid()`. The version is compiled into the running worker, not read from
installed metadata. JSON formatting is bounded and checked before sending.
The source/patch regression checks the pinned patch chain and verifies that no
other worker source changes. Compiler and PS5 runtime acceptance of this addition
remain pending; existing validation results do not cover it.
